# TelecomsXChange (TCXC) -  Smart Contract for the Blockchain

This smart contract is responsible for processing important data (string values)from the centrelized application and save it on the blockchain for future refernece. For example backup buyer prepaid balance every 1 hour and save it on the blockchain.

`P.S: This smart contract publishes up to 32 bytes at a time.`

How we use this Smart Contract at TelecomsXChange:

- Sellers can sync their wallet (balance) to the blockchain every X minutes, hours, days.

- Buyers can sync their prepaid balance to the blockchain every X minutes, hours, days.

Since miners prefer smaller transactions because easier to fit them in block, the typical token transfer if around `50k gasm`, This smart contract TX is `25k gas` which is less and affordable.

We hope you find it useful and enable you to easily put important data on the blockchain.


### What other potential uses:

This smart contract pushes any sort of text to the blockchain, so you can store any valuable data to the blockchain like CDRs, SDRs or simply any text that you think is valauble.
